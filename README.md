======================
Pokerbot
======================
An artificial intelligence in Python designed to play online poker on Seals With Clubs.

======================
DEPENDENCIES
======================
-Python 2.7.3  
-Pytesser (Because pytesser lacks an installer, all the files must be unpacked into the project directory.)  
-Seals With Clubs client  
-Pokermuck  

======================
USAGE
======================
Once entered for a single game (I'll later add auto registration for freerolls and multitabling support) run Pokermuck, the HUD for SWC. Then run bot.py.
